# Bicubic Splines Like Methods

by Xingyu Zhu

<xingyu.zhu@duke.edu>

This repo contains a set of codes for Bicubic Splines, PCHIPs (Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolation Polynomial),Cubic Convolution Interpolation, Bicubic Convolution Interpolation, and Weight Bicubic Splines implemented in Python.

Such algorithms are useful in performing numerical approximations in a 2-D large data grid, and are important in computational graphics such as smooth 2-D image resampling.

This project is done for the final project for MATH361S
