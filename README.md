# Bicubic Conv Splines

A set of codes for Bicubic Splines, Cubic Convolution Interpolation, Bicubic Convolution Interpolation, and Weight Bicubic Splines implemented in Python.

Such algorithms are useful in performing numerical approximations in a 2-D large data grid, and are important in computational graphics such as smooth 2-D image resampling.

### Progress
Finished Bilinear & Nearest as well as a basic main.py (19/04/04)
